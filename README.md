We have a square matrix with entries 0 and 1. We are only allowed to change one of the 0s to 1s. We will write a programme to return size of largest part of the matrix that contain 1 only. Area is equal to number of 1s inside the matrix. Largest part is equal to 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
We are using Python 3 here.
